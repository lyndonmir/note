# 2.1 Sets
## Some Concepts of Sets
- Set
- element / member
- cardinality
- finite
## description 
- Roster method
- Brace notation with ellipses
- set builder
- venn diagrams
## relations between two sets
- subset
- equal
- proper subset
## power set
- number
## cartesian products
## true sets of quantifiers
# 2.2 Set Operations
## Set Operations
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Complement of a set
- Symmetric difference
## Set Identities
- Identitiy laws
- Domination laws
- Idempotent laws
- Complementation law
- Commutative laws
- Associative laws
- Distributive laws
- De Morgan's laws
## Ways to prove set identities
- Show that $A\in B$ and that $B\in A$ : Use one element to prove
- Use logical equivalences to prove equivalent set definitions: Use set builder notation and logical equivalences
- Use a membership table
- Use previously proven identities
# 2.3 Function
## Concepts
- function/mapping/transformations
- domain
- codomain
- range
- image
- preimage
- f maps A to B
## Equivalence
- $(f_{1}+f_{2})=f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x)$
- $(f_{1}f_{2})(x)=f_{1}(x)f_{2}(x)$
- $f(S)=\lbrace{{f(s)|s\in S}}\rbrace$
- $f(\emptyset)=\emptyset$
- $f(\lbrace a \rbrace)=\lbrace f(a) \rbrace$
- $f(A\cup B)=f(A)\cup f(B)$
- $f(A \vee B) \in f(A) \vee f(B)$
## The Graphs of Functions
- set of ordered pairs
## One-to-One and Onto Functions
- One-to-One Functions , or injective
- Onto Functions , or surjective, surjection
- One-to-one Correspondence Functions or bijection
- Showing f is one-to-one or onto
## Other Functions
- Monotonic Functions
- Inverse Functions(must bijection)
- Compositions of Functions
- The floor function
- The ceiling function
## Properties of Functions
- Useful Properties of the floor and ceiling functions

# 2.4 Sequence and Summations 
## Sequence
- definition
- Notation
- order matters
- terms
## Geometric Progression
## Arithmetic Progression
## Special Interger Sequences
### Deduce a possible formula from initial terms
- same value
- cycles
- by adding the same amount or an amount that depends on the position in the sequence
- by multiplying by a particular amount
- by combining previous terms in a certain way
## Summations
## Concepts
- index of summation
- lower limit
- upper limit
### Some useful Summation Formulae

# 2.5 Cardinality of Sets
## The cardinality of an infinite set
- |A| = |B| iff there exits a bijection from A to B
- |A| <= |B| if there is an injection from A to B
## Countable and Uncountable
### Definition
- Countable
- Uncountable
- aleph null
- countable infinite
### Some Countable Infinite Sets
- Set of even positive integers
- Set of integers Z
- Set of positive rational numbers $Q^{+}$, $Q$, $Q^{-}$
### Properties of the countable sets
- No infinite set has a smaller cardinality than a countable set
- The union of a countable number of countable sets is countable
## Cantor Diagonalization Argument
- The set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is uncountable
- The set of real numbers R has the sme cardinality as the set (0,1)
- Example 5??
## Computability
- Computable/uncomputable
## Other theorem
- Schroder-Bernstein Theorem
- The cardinality of the power set of an arbitrary set has a greater cardinality than the original arbitrary set
- The continuum Hypothesis
